# Summary
ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Brandon Nguyen

Iâ€™m a U.S. Navy veteran and cybersecurity professional focused on application security. I work with dynamic testing tools daily, like Burp Suite, to identify and validate vulnerabilities in web and mobile applications while helping strengthen secure development practices.

My background includes securing and administering Linux and Windows systems that supported mission-critical operations. I hold multiple industry certifications including GWAPT, GCIH, and PNPT, and maintain an active Secret clearance.

I enjoy building and breaking systems the right way, learning new tools, and continually improving my technical skill set through hands-on testing and real-world scenarios.
